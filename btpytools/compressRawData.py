""" Compress raw data from a BakingTray acquisition to a tar.bz

Usage
cd to sample directory and run this command:
$ cd /mnt/data/somesample
$ compressRawData


Notes
If you have signed in via SSH and aren't in a tmux session, the function
asks for confirmation before continuing. If your ssh session breaks off
for some reason, then compression will fail. tmux is therefore recommended
in this situation.

The compression does not run if there is insufficient disk space. It does not run if
free_disk_space_GB < (uncompressed raw_data_size_GB * 0.7) + 500


Runs much faster with parallel bzip (lbzip2) installed. If this is missing, the tool reverts
to regular gzip.
